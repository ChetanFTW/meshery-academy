### Welcome to your Academy's content development environment

This is just a development page that shows during the build process. The development process is extraordinarily simple - you can start building it out bit by bit or dive right in.

#### What Your Academy Will Look Like

When published, your Academy will feature two main sections ([see example](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/)). 

Type of content includes:

- **[Certifications](/academy/certifications/)** - a formal assessment designed to validate a learner’s professional skills in a specific domain. Unlike a Learning Path, which guides a user through a curriculum, a Certification’s primary goal is evaluation. [Learn more](https://docs.layer5.io/cloud/academy/creating-content/building-certifications/)
- **[Challenges](/academy/challenges/)** - Time-based, practical labs to test and validate skills
- **[Learning Paths](/academy/learning-paths/)** - Structured courses combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on labs

#### Content Development Process

Simple overview:

1. **Develop locally** - Make your changes and test them here  
2. **Merge when ready** - Your Academy stays private until you decide to publish  
3. **Publish when ready** - Release it to your organization
